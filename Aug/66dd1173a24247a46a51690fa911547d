7 August 2017 The Minister of Communications, Ms Ayanda Dlodlo has been apprised on the successful recapitalisation of Cell C. The mobile operator is regulated by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa and is therefore one of the telecommunications sector’s stakeholders. We are pleased that the transaction has significantly increased the South African ownership of Cell C, and further saved an estimated 2 500 direct and 15 000 indirect jobs. Minister Dlodlo said “We recognise that the cost to communicate is too high for the majority of South Africans and government would like to see this reduced significantly, including the cost of data. To support the broadening of access to information for all our citizens, it is imperative to intensify competition in the South African telecommunications industry”. Government is committed to working with the private sector and labour towards inclusive growth and the development of the telecommunications sector. This also reaffirms South Africa as an attractive investment destination. We wish Cell C all the very best as they strive to deliver cost effective and quality services to South Africans at affordable rates Enquiries:  Ms Pheliswa Sebati Cell: 082 413 4609 Issued by: Department of Communications
