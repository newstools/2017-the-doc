19 April 2017 Government notes the comments made by the former Chief Operating Officer of The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng, and a group of artists during a media briefing held today. Minister of Communications, Ayanda Dlodlo stated that the Broadcasting Act clearly makes provision for the President to appoint the interim board within 10 days of receiving recommendations from the National Assembly. The National Assembly made recommendations of five names to constitute the SABC Interim Board. The President thereafter appointed all the five nominated people to constitute the Interim Board for a period of 6 months, and as such enjoy the confidence of the shareholder. “As government we would like to assure the public  that the current interim board is a legally constituted Board. The Board has been mandated to implement the SABC Adhoc Committee recommendations and should be afforded the space to do its work. It is expected that the Interim Board should ensure proper functionality of the South African Broadcasting Cooperation so as to deliver on its public mandate as per Broadcasting Act. “We reassert our full confidence in the capability of the current Interim Board to execute its mandate” said Dlodlo. We call on all role players to allow the board and its authority to execute its duties. Enquiries: Phumla WilliamsCell: 083 501 0139 Issued by Ministry of Communication
