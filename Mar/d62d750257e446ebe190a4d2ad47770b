2 March 2017The demand for government subsidised set-top-boxes is on the rise as seen in the increased number of registrations across various parts of the country. For the month of February a total of 36 042 households registered for these decoders, compared to 11 709 registrations captured for January. It is encouraging to see the growth in demand. The increase in registrations is a strong indication of the success of the migration project, said Muthambi. Awareness is growing day by day and people appreciate the tangible benefits that come with this process, she added.Officials from the Department of Communications and the South African Post Office have been instrumental in raising awareness and increasing registrations. The Northern Cape and Free State provinces have already gone through a set-top-box installation phase. This month the installation of set-top-boxes will resume in other borderline provinces such as Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal. So far, a total of 18 analogue transmitters have been switched-off since October last year in the area surrounding the Square Kilometre Array in the Northern Cape. Digital terrestrial television services provide us with a rich opportunity to realise the vision of building a people-centred and inclusive information society, added Muthambi.Enquiries: Mish Molakeng: 082 429 3997 Issued by Department of Communications
