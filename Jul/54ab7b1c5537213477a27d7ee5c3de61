27 July 2017 The Deputy Minister of Communications Ms Tandi Mahambehlala will embark on the Eastern Cape leg of the Kalushi Screenings as part of the Departments efforts to promote social cohesion in society. The FPB is an essential part of the film industry as it ensures that film content is duly classified and generally compliant with the Films and Publications Act (FP Act). In the past FPB has partnered with production houses, screened movies such as: Andrew Mlangeni Story, Push and Shove, Right of Passage and Cry of Love. Film screening is one of the many mechanisms FPB uses to raise awareness about content classification and the FP Act. On Friday 28 July 2017 the film Kalushi will be screened at the Hemmingway Shopping Centre in East London to the youth of the surrounding communities. There screening will begin at 11 am. “The National Development Plan incentivises the production and distribution of all art forms that facilitate healing, nation building and dialogue. Kalushi is an epitome of what the NDP envisions and is an excellent catalyst for cohesive dialogues about past and the future”, said Mahambehlala.
