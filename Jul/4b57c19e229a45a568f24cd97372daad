5 July 2017 Minister of Communications, Ms Ayanda Dlodlo has convened a meeting on the Broadcasting Digital Migration process with broadcasters, SABC, Etv, StarSat, and stakeholders participating in the programme.  The meeting will take place on Thursday, 06th July 2017. The 8th  June 2017  Court ruling on the Digital Terrestrial Television process paved a way for the Minister to make a decision regarding the encrypt or non- encryption of Set-Top- Boxes.  The meeting is a  step closer to ensuring that the Broadcasting Digital Migration process is implemented without delay. The aim is to ensure that all affected stakeholders jointly come up with a plan that will assist government to meet its obligation to  ensure that South Africans are migrated from analogue to digital television platforms by December 2018.
