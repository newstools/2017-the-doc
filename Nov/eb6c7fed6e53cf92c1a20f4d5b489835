The Minister of Communications, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane has noted with concern the misleading media reports about her comments during a 702 radio interview on the allegations of corruption between Multichoice and Africa News Network (ANN7 TV). The media narrative that Minister Kubayi-Ngubane will call for a probe into alleged corruption linked to payments made by Multichoice to ANN7 TV are factually incorrect. The Minister reiterates that the Department of Communications cannot get involved on contractual issues between two private parties. The department will only engage on broadcasting policy related matters. Minister Kubayi-Ngubane said:  “There are relevant authorities of government that are competent to deal with any crime or corruption related matters. Members of the public are encouraged to follow the right channels to report any criminal activities.” Furthermore, Minister has noted the media reports on the purported decision by lobby groups for Multichoice to remove ANN7 from DSTV.  Minister Kubayi-Ngubane cannot be party to such engagement. However, it is the Minister’s wish to categorically indicate that such act or move is against the prescript of our Constitution. While noting the fundamental importance of a Constitutional right to freedom of expression, lobby groups have no right to remove any media house from broadcasting networks. Minister is lastly appealing to the citizens to uphold the Constitutional rights of freedom of expression and editorial independence as such needs to be respected at all times.
