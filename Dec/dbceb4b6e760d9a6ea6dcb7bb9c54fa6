Minister Kubayi-Ngubane calls on all stakeholders to engage in a peaceful and constructive wage negotiations. “The SABC has experienced revenue loss in the past, as a result the current financial situation at the broadcasting corporation is untenable.

Furthermore, Minister appeal for patience to allow the negotiations and consultation process to unfold in a much more balanced manner thus taking into account all factors and concerns raised by all parties.   Enquiries:Ireen Mmatlou MagwaiCell: 082 440 5676
